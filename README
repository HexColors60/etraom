	Etraom
	a traditional roguelike
	--

	And by traditional, I mean it's text-based, powered by curses, its levels
	are randomly generated, and it features permadeath. No graphics, no genre
	blending. A traditional roguelike.

	Building requires curses. To build Etraom, just run the Makefile provided.

	As the game (currently) has no help included, here are the controls:
		movement via either vi-keys, numpad or arrows
		[q] quit
		[m] reveal current map - expect this to be removed in the future
		[5] / [.] wait a turn
		[>] follow stairs
		[,] pick up item
		[i] inventory screen
		[o] open door
		[c] close door
		[x] look at
		[f] fire ranged weapon
		[r] reload weapon
		[U] unload weapon
		[M] show message buffer

	A rough list of features to be expected for version 0.1:
		* win condition
		* fully functional combat - melee and ranged
		* diverse enemies
		* diverse environments
		* random weapon generator
		* tons of loot, including tons of trash
