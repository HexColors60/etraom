	Etraom
	a traditional roguelike
	--

	And by traditional, I mean it's text-based, powered by curses, its levels
	are randomly generated, and it features permadeath. No graphics, no genre
	blending. A traditional roguelike.

	Building requires curses. To build Etraom, just run the Makefile provided.

	Etraom is released under the Simplified BSD License. See LICENSE for
	details.

	Contributions of any kind are appreciated, so fork away!
