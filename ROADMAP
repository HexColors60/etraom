	Roadmap for Etraom
	--

I.		Infrastructure

	[x] weapon struct
		[x] damage
		[ ] accuracy
	[ ] consumable struct
	[x] armor struct
	[x] ammo struct
		* more fields?
	[ ] links can obscure items on the ground
		* disallow placement of items on ground
	[ ] effects
		* entity_t should have an array of (stackable) effects:
			int effect[MAX_EFFECTS];
		* weapons should also have effects
		* individual effects should be accesible via
			effect[EFFECT_BURNING] etc.
	[ ] showing messages should be moved in the function responsible for the
		action in cause, if possible
	[ ] corpses?

II.		Mechanics

	[ ] combat
		[x] melee
		[x] ranged
			[ ] ammo consumption
			[ ] clip distribution
		[ ] distribution between physical and armor damage
		* damage should be either melee-dealt or bullet-dealt
		* weapons can also have a chance to trigger a certain effect
		* ex.: Flaming Club of Doom (damage: 2-4, chance to light on fire: 20%)
	[ ] attributes
	[ ] skills

III.	Map generators

	[ ] dla
	[ ] cooridor diffusion

IV.		UI

	[x] message log
	[x] single inventory menu for all actions
	[x] look command
	[ ] change screen layout (?)
		* two-line message area, removing the need of using --MORE--
		* map size would be reduced to 80x21
		* if messages still are lengthier than the provided space, send the
		  player into the message buffer
